# FirstTo100

A simple 2 player game where the goal is to reach 100 points using a die.
You can roll as much times as you wish but be careful because if you roll a 1 you lose your turn along with everything you rolled that turn.
If you feel a one coming you can hold your current roles and pass your turn to the next player.
